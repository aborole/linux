# Nvidia drivers installation

After Kubuntu installation, by default "nuveau" graphics driver was installed, and only AMD integrated graphics controller was being used.
Due to this, when laptop went to sleep, it didn't wakeup and have to reboot it.

On one forum, it was mentioned, that this might be due to NVidia graphics card issue, so installed Nvidia graphics card drivers with below steps:
